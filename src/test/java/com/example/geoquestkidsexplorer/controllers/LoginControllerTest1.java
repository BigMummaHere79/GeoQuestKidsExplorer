/*Login Unit Testing

 //Credential Validation
 //Account Status Checks
 //Security/Rate Limiting
 //Optional/Edge Cases

 //Need to test for (Note to self):
 For each method/stimulation of user input:
 True outcomes (success cases):
  Ensures method does what it’s supposed to do in normal scenarios.
  Confirms that users can actually log in when credentials are valid.
 False outcomes (failure cases)
  Ensures code doesn’t allow invalid operations.
  Prevents security flaws (like letting someone log in with wrong credentials).
  Confirms that errors/exceptions are handled correctly.


// Explanation:
Focuses on accessing an existing account:

Are all required fields filled?  (similar to registration)

Does the username/email exist?

Does the password match the stored password?

Is the account locked, disabled, or unverified?

Are there too many failed attempts? */
